I am a graduate student from Northeastern University, majoring in Economics (expected to graduate in 2024). I received my Accounting and Economics double Bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of Sydney. **I am actively looking for data, business and finance analysis coop or summer intern opportunities**. Please feel free to reach out to me via [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijingliu/).

I will keep posting interesting technique problems and solutions on this website. Those topics cover programming languages (R, Python, SQL), data analysis and visualization tools (STATA, Excel), finance and mathematical modelling, and web development. I came across these problems with past internship, class projects, and self learning. Please do not hesitate to leave a comment in any blog post if you have questions or are interested in a certain topic.

Happy Reading:)
